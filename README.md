# Kaggle competitions

Trying previous kaggle competitions with new ideas

All kaggle competitions are divided into --

- Featured
  Featured competitions are the types of competitions that Kaggle is probably best known for. These are full-scale machine learning challenges which pose difficult, generally commercially-purposed prediction problems.

- Research
  Research competitions are another common type of competition on Kaggle. Research competitions feature problems which are more experimental than featured competition problems.

- Getting Started
  Getting Started competitions are the easiest, most approachable competitions on Kaggle. These are semi-permanent competitions that are meant to be used by new users just getting their foot in the door in the field of machine learning. They offer no prizes or points. Because of their long-running nature, Getting Started competitions are perhaps the most heavily tutorialized problems in machine learning - just what a newcomer needs to get started!

- Playground
  Playground competitions are a “for fun” type of Kaggle competition that is one step above Getting Started in difficulty. These are competitions which often provide relatively simple machine learning tasks, and are similarly targeted at newcomers or Kagglers interested in practicing a new type of problem in a lower-stakes setting. Prizes range from kudos to small cash prizes.

- Recruitment
  teams of size one compete to build machine learning models for corporation-curated challenges. At the competition’s close, interested participants can upload their resume for consideration by the host. The prize is (potentially) a job interview at the company or organization hosting the competition.

- Annual
  While not a strict competition type per se, Kaggle maintains two annual competition traditions.

- miscellaneous
  which are not under any topic

Along with above categories all competitions are also given a tag about th problem
