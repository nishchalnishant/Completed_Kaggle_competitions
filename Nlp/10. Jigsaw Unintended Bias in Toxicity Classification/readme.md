Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification --

>> Detect toxicity across a diverse range of conversations.
>> build a model that recognizes toxicity and minimizes this type of unintended bias with respect to mentions of identities.
>> dataset labeled for identity mentions and optimizing a metric designed to measure unintended bias.
>> Develop strategies to reduce unintended bias in machine learning models, and you'll help the Conversation AI team, and the entire industry, build models that work well for a wide range of conversations.
